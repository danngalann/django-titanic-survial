# Titanic Survival Predictor
This is the final implementation of my [titanic death classifier](https://github.com/danngalann/titanic-death-classifier), yet another fullstack project with Django, and the first one where I implemented a pre-trained model on a user-friendly website.

## Stuff I used on this project
* GSAP for animations
* pipenv to manage a Python virtual enviroment
* scikit-learn to train and serve an SVC classifier
* Django to serve the website and the API that makes the predictions
